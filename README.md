## Dependencies

This project uses Pipenv to manage dependencies. In order to install these dependencies which can be viewed in `Pipfile` a single command `pipenv install` can be run. The experiment can then be rerun by running `pipenv shell` followed by `py main.py`. This will generate the 6 different maps available in `worlds/`. This process can be pretty costly and took over 30 minutes on a Ryzen 7 5800x.
